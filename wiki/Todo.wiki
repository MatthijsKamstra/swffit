= Introduction =

This page is used to keep track of ideas for future features and optimizations. Some stuff may already been done and some may never be done... So *don't take it too serious...*

== Todo ==
  * remove closures and listeners on `onunload` on IE to avoid memory leaks.
  * add public methods to return window `innerHeight` and `innerWidth`.
  * add public methods to return body `scrollTop` and `scrollLeft`.
  * change `addEventListener` structure and add `window.scroll` Event.
  * change way swffit sets the minimum/maximum size to a full CSS based method to improve performance but keeping current method for browsers that doesn't support `min-width`/`max-width`.
  * only enable swffit if flash movie was embedded to avoid alternate content being displayed on the wrong position as described on [http://groups.google.com/group/swffit/browse_thread/thread/6ce037dfcb1e1ff2].
  * optimize source code.

== Maybe ==

  * add fix for flash movie files bigger than 4000px as described on [http://groups.google.com/group/swffit/browse_thread/thread/d493f159a009689/].
